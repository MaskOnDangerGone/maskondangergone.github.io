							<h3>The Problem</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Many teenagers think that they are too "cool" to wear masks. They don't think much about the consequences, and this rash behavior is highly likely to hurt people who are more prone to infection. For this pandemic to stop, everybody needs to do their part, and this includes teenagers wearing their masks.

							<h3>Some Alarming Data</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							For context there are ~641,000 deaths and ~15,000,000 cases of COVID-19 around the world. This number is extremely large and could be a LOT smaller if people wore proper protection and followed proper procedures in countries like the US. However, there are some less fortunate people who can't afford these masks because of their inflation in pricing. By raising money for COVID-19 through the American Red Cross Foundation, we can help flatten the curve!

							<h3>The Pledge</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Show this to your endorser and have them sign it:
						</p>
						<blockquote>"I’m thinking about joining the Mask On, Danger Gone to help flatten the curve. I will be more responsible by properly wearing protective masks when stepping out. To incentivize me and help the cause, would you pledge me 1 dollar for every time I go outside/hang out with friends while always wearing my mask? All the proceeds would be donated to the American Red Cross Foundation.”</blockquote>
